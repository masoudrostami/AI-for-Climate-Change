# **AI for Climate Change: Mitigate Greenhouse Gases Emissions by reducing the energy consumption of buildings**

### **Background**

Climate change is a globally relevant, urgent, and multi-faceted issue heavily impacted by **energy policy** and **infrastructure**. Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences).  Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electrical systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. 

According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition was responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. For example, retrofitted buildings can reduce heating and cooling energy requirements by 50-90 percent. Many of these energy efficiency measures also result in overall cost savings and yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide.

## *THE PROBLEM*:

- Data provided can be augmented with “meteorological data” such as **temperature**, **wind speed**, and **pressure**.  One of the major variables for building energy prediction is “**meteorological data**”. [Ref.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037877881932047X) 

- One of the **key challenge** will be to choose a subset of appropriate features which impact the energy dynamics of a building to be used in model training.

- Researchers suggest that the availability of a **building energy system with accurate forecasting is projected to save between 10 and 30% of total energy consumption in buildings**. Thus, the continuous effort to enhance building energy prediction is essential for more efficient buildings. 

The advancement of data-driven models has produced satisfactory energy estimation results. Although, without the detection of an algorithm that can accurately predict building energy consumption, this will increase greenhouse gas emissions, construction of more inefficient buildings, energy demand, and decrease in financial savings.
